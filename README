# Backend Practice Project

This practice project is designed to illustrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a backend application using Docker. It provides a simple example of how to integrate a web server with a database, using Docker containers to manage the environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project uses `docker-compose` to simplify the management of the Docker containers.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from the following links:

- [Install Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Install Docker on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Install Docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-practice-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend-practice-project
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers using `docker-compose`:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Usage

Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can access the backend service through your web browser or API client at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Add new entries to the database through the API endpoint.
- **Read**: Fetch existing entries from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing entries in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove existing entries from the database.

### Managing Docker Containers

- To start the services, use:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```
  
- To stop the services, use:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- To view the logs of the services, use:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

### Technical Stack

- **Web Server**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) / [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) / [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
